Export is a jquery library that allow you to export your HTML page content into PNG, JPG & GIF formats. It requires the d3.js library, html2canvas (http://html2canvas.hertzen.com)
and htmltable_export (https://github.com/kayalshri/tableExport.jquery.plugin) libraries.

Browsers must allow popup !
Works for Firefox and Safari, problem with Chrome to load files (html2canvas) from external sites. So please load all files in yours local repository by using github.
